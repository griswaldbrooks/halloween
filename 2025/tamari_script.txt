I would like to recruit you to find my four little birds.
Please feast on what bounties lie here, for this mission carries the worst of omens, and I know not when joy will meet you next. 

I believe the nefarious Cult of Arachne have fled their lair, and the dark stirs with grim rumors that their final ritual revealed an  unbearable truth, something that disturbed even their foul minds.

I’m sure my little birds are posted in each chamber of the lair. 
Venture forth into the abandoned tunnels, and find what messages my birds have to share.

I implore you, I need to hear from each bird, the Kingdom of Weymouth demands it. 
The kingdom of Weymouth must be made aware of what you discover.

Here, take this torch, you’re going to need it.
