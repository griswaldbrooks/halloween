00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,820 [Speaker 0]
Okay. We are now entering the garage, which was the final chamber called the spider's lair. 

00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:20,220 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, first comment about, from Tamari here, uh, about the entry to this space. I actually do not like it being this narrow. Either- 

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,730 [Speaker 0]
Uh, this narrow or this low? 

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,340 [Speaker 1]
Both. 

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:22,580 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,480 [Speaker 1]
I do not like the, the, the entryway actually being something that you need to duck under the garage for. 

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:28,940 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:35,520 [Speaker 1]
I would prefer it if it was like, this was up, the garage door was open all the way, but you had cobwebs- 

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,060 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,520 [Speaker 1]
... that were the, the, the height barrier so that, A, you don't hit your head on the garage door- 

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:41,530 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,800 [Speaker 1]
... if you're not paying attention and if you get scared. 

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,660 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,360 [Speaker 1]
But B, um, 

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,980 [Speaker 1]
you can still use cobweb to visually block what's in the next space without- 

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,610 [Speaker 0]
There being a physical barrier 

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,340 [Speaker 1]
... physical barrier. 

00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,010 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Okay. 

00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,280 [Speaker 1]
The thing, the, the comment about the width. 

00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,540 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:10,539 [Speaker 1]
So, um, I identified like an opportunity, um, too late in the game for having this space be a place where you take a photo 

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,460 [Speaker 1]
of people during a jump scare. So, I was crouched in the other corner- 

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,500 [Speaker 0]
Oh 

00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,640 [Speaker 1]
... basically trying to catch ... You know, like when you're on a roller coaster- 

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:20,720 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:34,660 [Speaker 1]
... and you go down, people get scared, you get a photo? So I kinda like the idea of this whole haunted house thing being like a ride that you go and like, the final thing, the jump scare worked on everybody for the most part. 

00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,100 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,460 [Speaker 1]
And but for, for the sake of giving people like a, a cool memento of going through this- 

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,460 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,160 [Speaker 1]
... I couldn't get a picture of any like group of four- 

00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,500 [Speaker 0]
Right 

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,780 [Speaker 1]
... being jump scared. 

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:48,890 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,380 [Speaker 1]
And part of the problem with that is that half of the space was blocked. 

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,560 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,720 [Speaker 1]
So everybody was proceeding with caution, expecting a jump scare or something- 

00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,580 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,220 [Speaker 1]
... in single file. 

00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,880 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:09,240 [Speaker 1]
So, I would like to either have a camera that I mount up top or we make this wide enough to encourage people to enter as a group. 

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:21,840 [Speaker 0]
Yep. Okay. So comment about the, the technical comment about why this is so narrow. It was a oversight in the physical construction because we were looking for a place to attach some of the decorative netting. 

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:21,870 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:32,280 [Speaker 0]
And we just went with the, the handle which is in the middle, which cuts off the width of the door. And then because we were doing that, then we just blocked off that whole side with netting. 

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,679 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,340 [Speaker 0]
Um, I think the netting in here was a triumph. 

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,500 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,820 [Speaker 0]
It's a really good resource that made setting this up really easy. 

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,640 [Speaker 1]
Yes, it is. Yes. 

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:54,280 [Speaker 0]
In the light here, you can still tell, "Oh, it's a garage," and all this stuff. But in the dark, all of that kind of just like fade into the background. You didn't really see that it was, "Oh, this is a garage." 

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,480 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:09,880 [Speaker 0]
Um, the projector, uh, can I, can I get some, some comments from, from Dan about when ... So, there's a projection of the spiders crawling on some of the netting. Uh, Dan, what did you think about that? 

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,500 [Speaker 2]
Um, 

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:19,060 [Speaker 2]
I thought that the ... Honestly, I did, I did not notice the spiders on the netting in this room. 

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,370 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:19,380 [Speaker 3]
Yeah. 

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,079 [Speaker 2]
It is, it is obvious in the t- well, it's more obvious in the tunnel. 

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,280 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:34,920 [Speaker 2]
I though would ... I even thought in the tunnel in the, you know, that, that first room, uh, I th- I wanted more contra- like, I, I want them just to be sharper. 

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,170 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,180 [Speaker 3]
Yes. 

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,250 [Speaker 2]
And that might just be a technical limitation of the projectors. 

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:37,960 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. It, it, it, it- 

00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:50,520 [Speaker 1]
So, I have an idea of how that could be better. Um, so I think part of the issue with why that it's n- it, you get a lower contrast is because you essentially have a worse screen. 

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,020 [Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. 

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,540 [Speaker 1]
A worse, uh, so if you, you're, if you're using a projector- 

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:54,570 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,520 [Speaker 1]
... and you have a nice flat- 

00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,780 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,780 [Speaker 1]
... panel, you can get nicer, sharp contrast. 

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,000 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,700 [Speaker 1]
So, what if- 

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,690 [Speaker 0]
But actually those panels are actually a little bit reflective. 

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:04,700 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,160 [Speaker 0]
They build them so that they even bounce even more light back. 

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,460 [Speaker 2]
Oh. 

00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:16,220 [Speaker 1]
Yes. So, what if instead of having just cobwebs draped, the space that has a projection on it- 

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,740 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,680 [Speaker 1]
... is white sheet. 

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,100 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,940 [Speaker 1]
You can have cobweb on it- 

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,079 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,690 [Speaker 1]
... but just more aggressively. And it doesn't even need- 

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:23,740 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,580 [Speaker 1]
... to be super flat. 

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,800 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,120 [Speaker 1]
What I was imagining is like we could block more of the stuff that we're trying to hide off. 

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,590 [Speaker 0]
We ran out of sheets, is what happened. 

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:32,620 [Speaker 1]
I know. 

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,200 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,380 [Speaker 1]
But we have other stuff so if we, um, if we made basically like even like a curved wall- 

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,550 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm 

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,440 [Speaker 1]
... of sheet- 

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,580 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,880 [Speaker 1]
... that you also had cobweb on, because it's kind of flat-ish- 

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,020 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,460 [Speaker 1]
... that, that, that visual of the spiders would be more effective. 

00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:00,820 [Speaker 0]
Yep. And, uh, I did not like the positioning of the projector. Um, again, just wasn't enough time. 

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,060 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:09,630 [Speaker 0]
But I think in hindsight looking at it, the ... Was initially worried about people like s- kind of seeing the man behind the curtain thing. 

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:09,640 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:19,219 [Speaker 0]
And actually that was way less of a problem than I thought. So, the projector actually could've been extended a little bit further out so it pointed more into the space of the garage. 

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,820 [Speaker 2]
Well, so- 

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,720 [Speaker 1]
I actually want it up here. 

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,240 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, so- 

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,960 [Speaker 0]
Or up on the ceiling was what point- 

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:24,990 [Speaker 2]
This is- 

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,760 [Speaker 0]
... Tamari's pointing at. 

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,850 [Speaker 2]
This is why ... So, I have returned to the entryway towards the garage. 

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:29,920 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:37,380 [Speaker 2]
And when you stand back here, too much of the other netting actually blocks [alarm sound] the view of the projected portion. 

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:37,650 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,120 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,630 [Speaker 2]
So, if this is supposed ... 'Cause frankly you don't, you're, you're not really in the projection zone until you are past the jump scare. 

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,650 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,219 [Speaker 2]
And at that point- 

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,300 [Speaker 0]
Okay 

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,770 [Speaker 2]
... you've already taken the shot. 

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:47,800 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:56,364 [Speaker 2]
So, maybe the projector is actually hidden-... on the other half of the, uh, the two-car garage pointed over some of this netting- 

00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:56,373 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:05:56,373 --> 00:06:00,264 [Speaker 2]
... and shining on the, the walls at the start- 

00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:00,514 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:00,514 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:01,544 [Speaker 2]
... of the tunnel. 

00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:01,714 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:01,724 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:03,844 [Speaker 2]
The first half rather than the back half. 

00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:11,264 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, and one of the, one of, I thought the purposes of having the projection is to draw your eye this way and less this way. Did you know- 

00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:11,284 [Speaker 2]
I, I- 

00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:14,384 [Speaker 0]
Did you notice that this was here? Like, I mean, you knew it was here, but... 

00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:19,164 [Speaker 2]
I knew it was gonna be there. I like the idea of the, the visual distraction, yeah. 

00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:19,304 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:23,234 [Speaker 2]
Like, you enter the space, the projection makes you look left. 

00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:23,244 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:26,563 [Speaker 2]
And then spider, big spider jumps out at the right. 

00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:27,124 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:33,364 [Speaker 2]
Uh, one idea, might be too excessive, is w- we, we do have that skittering noise- 

00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:33,374 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:06:33,374 --> 00:06:37,724 [Speaker 2]
... from the first tunnel. Maybe there is the skittering noise playing again in this room. 

00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:38,024 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:38,584 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:51,384 [Speaker 2]
To mix it up, maybe this is too subtle and not worth it that, in this room, in addition to the small skittering, infrequently, there is brief sections of bigger, louder skitterings- 

00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:51,474 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm 

00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:53,484 [Speaker 2]
... that implies there's something else. 

00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:53,904 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:59,004 [Speaker 2]
My, to talk about the, the papier-mâché spi- the, the big spider jump scare... 

00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,324 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:06,764 [Speaker 2]
... I actually kinda want the spider, would have liked the spider to come out a bit farther. 

00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:07,693 [Speaker 0]
Yes, absolutely. 

00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:07,724 [Speaker 1]
Yes, yes. 

00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:09,124 [Speaker 0]
We all, we all, uh- 

00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:09,294 [Speaker 1]
We all had that same- 

00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:22,704 [Speaker 0]
... think that that was a, uh, technical limitation of what we used at the time. The rail, uh, wasn't long enough. Um, if I were to do this again, actually, I would, uh ... [clears throat] Sorry. Initially ... 

00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:22,844 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:28,563 [Speaker 0]
... the thought was that this was, that the, the big spider was supposed to be automatic. 

00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:28,764 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:28,804 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:33,124 [Speaker 0]
I think we agree that it's better as an operated prop. 

00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:33,644 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:35,224 [Speaker 0]
It's fun. It was fun for me. 

00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:35,563 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:36,264 [Speaker 0]
Right? 

00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:36,324 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:36,484 [Speaker 0]
Um ... 

00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:39,264 [Speaker 1]
We also get to be here and watch people get scared, so that ... 

00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:39,524 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:39,844 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:40,394 [Speaker 0]
So that's nice. 

00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:40,424 [Speaker 2]
It's been- 

00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:43,454 [Speaker 1]
We weren't in the party for most of the time, but we were having fun- 

00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:43,693 [Speaker 2]
Oh, good 

00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:44,254 [Speaker 1]
... listening. 

00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:45,284 [Speaker 0]
Yep. So in the future- 

00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:47,794 [Speaker 2]
That, that lets you time the jump scare- 

00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:48,154 [Speaker 1]
Yes. Exactly. 

00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,743 [Speaker 2]
... appropriate to the group. 

00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:49,943 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:49,974 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:53,904 [Speaker 2]
And pay attention, what is the group doing? What are they engaging with? Hit them when it- 

00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:54,054 [Speaker 0]
Right 

00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:54,884 [Speaker 2]
... when it's, when it's best. 

00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:54,904 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:07:54,904 --> 00:08:02,764 [Speaker 0]
And so if I were to do this in the future, I probably would not use the linear rail. There is a, a different, like, swinging system I could have employed. 

00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:03,034 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. 

00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:07,804 [Speaker 0]
And actually, because it's manually operated, I coulda just probably had a rope or something- 

00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:08,004 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:09,634 [Speaker 0]
... and just, like, threw it forward. 

00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:18,624 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. When we were initially talking about having the spider, like, jump out at you, jump scare type thing, we had kinda discussed it being higher up, right? 

00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:18,664 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,284 [Speaker 1]
So we wanted it higher up. 

00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:20,744 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:22,304 [Speaker 1]
So it was like ... 

00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:23,004 [Speaker 0]
Coming down at you. 

00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:23,984 [Speaker 1]
Coming down at you. 

00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:24,063 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,484 [Speaker 1]
Like a spider jumping down. 

00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:25,643 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:27,364 [Speaker 1]
Or, you know, dropping from a n- 

00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:29,673 [Speaker 2]
Which is the standard behavior of spiders. 

00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:29,724 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:40,244 [Speaker 2]
I will say, so yes, however, if you are going to do a drop-type jump scare in the victim room with the cocoon swinging down, this then becomes a very similar- 

00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:40,264 [Speaker 1]
Hmm. 

00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:42,483 [Speaker 2]
Like, you're, you're coming at them from the same direction. 

00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:42,664 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:43,544 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,384 [Speaker 2]
But yeah, thing to be considered. 

00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:46,404 [Speaker 0]
Yep. Um ... 

00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:51,144 [Speaker 1]
Um, can I point out something that I'm, I'm, I'm a little peeved about with this room? 

00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,044 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:08:52,044 --> 00:09:06,344 [Speaker 1]
I don't like how it's decorated. So when I pictured the, this, this lair, I actually really wanted it to be more minimalist. I wanted it to just be, like, cobweb ... 

00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:06,644 [Speaker 2]
Tunnel 

00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:07,304 [Speaker 1]
... tube. 

00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:07,723 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:31,264 [Speaker 1]
Just a cobweb tube that's just, like, straight up in your face that you are entering some place that is completely not, um, not a human space. So we really need to hide everything. I w- I wanted it to be, like, a white room made with cobweb, essentially, that you feel im- um, like a liminal space. 

00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:31,564 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:35,184 [Speaker 1]
Like, I, I think I mentioned this pre- I wanted a liminal space. 

00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:36,944 [Speaker 2]
You want something like a funnel-web? 

00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:37,544 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,824 [Speaker 2]
A s- funnel-web spider. 

00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:39,404 [Speaker 1]
Yes. Like, liminal spaces are creepy. 

00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:41,714 [Speaker 0]
Dan's showing a picture of a funnel-web spider. 

00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:48,624 [Speaker 1]
So you know there's probably a jump scare coming, but you're still walking into it and the whole place is eerie. 

00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:48,723 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:51,504 [Speaker 1]
Because none of it looks like anything familiar. 

00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:51,664 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:52,244 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:09:52,244 --> 00:10:04,393 [Speaker 1]
The whole thing could just be white. I wanted to block this whole side off, so it felt really uncomfortable. And that could solve the problem with the projector not- 

00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:04,393 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:15,104 [Speaker 1]
... um, having a nice, flat surface. If the whole thing is just a white, flat surface, you can also ... We have to do a better job of hiding spider 

00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,104 [Speaker 1]
... Sally. 

00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:16,524 [Speaker 0]
Sally. 

00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:20,943 [Speaker 1]
Hiding Sally so that you can't even see, like, a leg until ... 

00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:21,034 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,124 [Speaker 1]
... you're jump scared. 

00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:28,344 [Speaker 0]
Yep. And part of that is also the it- the, the, the throw of Sally needs to be, uh, longer- 

00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:28,483 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:33,284 [Speaker 0]
... so that it can be f- more fully retracted and none of it is sticking out, and then it can completely come out. 

00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:46,504 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. I actually think that we need to have ... It w- I don't know if we could time it right, but I think that we could time it where this is actually down, and we pull a rope to pull it up and shove S- Sally out. 

00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:47,134 [Speaker 0]
Yes. I think that- 

00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:49,204 [Speaker 1]
So you don't even know where she's coming from. 

00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,964 [Speaker 0]
I think that would've been a really good effect. 

00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:51,223 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:53,354 [Speaker 0]
I think that would've, uh, solved the problem- 

00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:53,354 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:10:53,354 --> 00:11:03,884 [Speaker 0]
... that Paul and I were having where we were like, "Oh, how do we arrange it so that it's, uh, you know, that there's a, that there's an opening," so if there was, since it's manually operated anyway- 

00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:04,094 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:11,124 [Speaker 0]
... if there is, a rope pull would be really easy to do to kind of, like, reveal and throw out the spider. And it makes a more dramatic movement as well. 

00:11:11,124 --> 00:11:15,124 [Speaker 1]
Yes. And, uh, 

00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:25,883 [Speaker 1]
for, for taking the photograph, by having, uh, like a more of a flat surface, it actually makes it a little bit easier to get a nice photo. 

00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:30,504 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. Um, slight change of topics. 

00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:30,864 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:39,424 [Speaker 2]
Uh, but still, still totally for this. One of ... Uh, with your idea of having a particularly blank tunnel- 

00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:39,504 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:44,764 [Speaker 2]
... it's creepy. Less, because it also helps to visually distinguish this room from all the others. 

00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:45,364 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:54,604 [Speaker 2]
Something that I think is a valuable or fun horror technique is when you see something creepy that you must still, like, go through. 

00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:54,794 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:55,204 [Speaker 2]
And so- 

00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:58,624 [Speaker 1]
Yes. You're entering a space you don't wanna enter, but you're doing it anyway. 

00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:03,223 [Speaker 2]
But you have ... So here is an idea that also plays with some of that misdirection. 

00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:03,424 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:05,584 [Speaker 0]
Dan has walked to the garage entrance. 

00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:12,964 [Speaker 2]
So, you have the tunnel from the garage entrance towards the exit. You've been told in the game that the exit is that way. 

00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:13,084 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:14,063 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:21,256 [Speaker 2]
What if-Instead of the skittering spiders, which is a visual effect you've already used- 

00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:21,965 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:25,096 [Speaker 2]
... that somewhere behind 

00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:36,695 [Speaker 2]
in, is ... I- in the tunnel webbing, hidden, there are sets of eight little lights arr- arranged like small spider eyes that occasionally blink in and out. 

00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:36,715 [Speaker 1]
[gasps] 

00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:36,896 [Speaker 4]
Hmm. 

00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:37,715 [Speaker 2]
And you put those- 

00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,766 [Speaker 1]
Oh, I love it. I love it. 

00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:38,996 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:41,896 [Speaker 2]
And you put those on the left side of the room. 

00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:41,935 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:48,094 [Speaker 2]
So, when you get to the doorway, you're peering into this tunnel of, of web- 

00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:48,236 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:52,315 [Speaker 2]
... and you will see that there's eyes blinking at you- 

00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:52,346 [Speaker 1]
Yes. Yes 

00:12:52,346 --> 00:12:52,346 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:12:52,346 --> 00:12:54,295 [Speaker 2]
... and you're looking the one way- 

00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:54,305 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:58,496 [Speaker 2]
... and then you get to the middle, and then the big spider jumps out at you on the other side. 

00:12:58,496 --> 00:12:58,545 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:58,736 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:03,156 [Speaker 1]
So, basically, you've entered a space that you shouldn't be in. 

00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:03,656 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. 

00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:16,236 [Speaker 1]
It feels like you need to get out, but fuck. And I start seeing you, and eventually, you s- stir the spider. 

00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:16,496 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. 

00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:23,336 [Speaker 1]
It would actually be kinda cool if this was a space that people had to ... Felt like they had to walk through- 

00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:23,795 [Speaker 2]
Carefully 

00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,896 [Speaker 1]
... carefully. 

00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:26,475 [Speaker 0]
What if we had- 

00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:26,486 [Speaker 2]
Oh 

00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:29,496 [Speaker 0]
... put, um, something on the ground, like- 

00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:29,945 [Speaker 2]
To crunch? 

00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:29,996 [Speaker 0]
To crunch. 

00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:32,055 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. I had s- same idea in the same moment. 

00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:32,356 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:32,746 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:40,256 [Speaker 0]
'Cause we had ... Uh, yeah. We could have, like, you know, excess papier-mâché that they just have to step on, right? That maybe- 

00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:40,746 [Speaker 1]
Like eggshells? 

00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,815 [Speaker 0]
Like eggshells that, like, maybe even as like- 

00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:42,825 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:47,915 [Speaker 0]
... some of those, um, some of those papier-mâchés where they're cut in half and now you have to step on them, and you're, you're breaking them. 

00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:48,215 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:48,975 [Speaker 0]
Right? 

00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:49,116 [Speaker 2]
Uh- 

00:13:49,116 --> 00:14:06,136 [Speaker 1]
And honestly, I pictured these spiders or cults, or whatever, I pictured them being organized. I don't think that they would have stuff spru- strewn randomly. So, if we're gonna have other stuff like this, I think it should be stacked somewhere. 

00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:06,675 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:13,705 [Speaker 2]
Well, uh, but, uh, again, I think that this room should be visually distinct. Each room should have a visual character. 

00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:13,756 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:17,055 [Speaker 2]
We've already done bodies thrown around in the trap door. 

00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:18,175 [Speaker 1]
So, let's not have bodies. 

00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:19,435 [Speaker 2]
I would think ... Yeah, it's gonna pull- 

00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:20,455 [Speaker 1]
Let's not have bodies. 

00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:23,915 [Speaker 2]
Especially if you want people looking left- 

00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:24,016 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:28,145 [Speaker 2]
... the visual interest should be out to the left, not generally- 

00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:28,145 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:29,295 [Speaker 2]
... distributed. 

00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:29,616 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:31,734 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. Yep. 

00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:37,616 [Speaker 1]
Is there a way ... So, so you think that the eyes blinking open should be on the left side? 

00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:42,856 [Speaker 2]
Y- I think it should be mostly straight, mostly straight ahead, so when you're at the entrance- 

00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:43,975 [Speaker 0]
You see it ahead of you 

00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:48,856 [Speaker 2]
... there's stuff ahead of you, and maybe some bias in the left, like back-left wall. 

00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:53,215 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, 'cause there's just a physical limitation of us using the, the right side of the space- 

00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:53,596 [Speaker 2]
Totally. Yeah 

00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:58,695 [Speaker 0]
... for where the, uh, the ... For us to hide and for us to have a thing mounted. 

00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:02,346 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, but it is also a useful misdirection that you are- 

00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:02,346 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:09,435 [Speaker 2]
... you're paying attention more left, so that you're less likely to notice whatever mechanism you have for throwing the big spider. 

00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:13,876 [Speaker 1]
What if, when you walk in, 

00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:17,136 [Speaker 1]
light ... So, what if 

00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:25,496 [Speaker 1]
the eyes start lighting up in the space where, if, they would see you? So, on the left. Church, on the left- 

00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:25,945 [Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. As you move- 

00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:29,656 [Speaker 1]
There's spider eyes. As you move- 

00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:29,866 [Speaker 2]
Eyes light up as you ... Oh 

00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:39,234 [Speaker 1]
... more of the eyes see you and you're like, "Oh, shit. What's going on?" You kinda start turning this way to look at the eyes- 

00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:39,346 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:58,116 [Speaker 1]
... 'cause it's a visual interesting thing. And instead of having the crunching stuff here, what if the crunchy stuff is here? And while you're paying attention to the eyes, you step on it. That causes the spider that's behind you to hear- 

00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:58,695 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:15:58,695 --> 00:15:59,675 [Speaker 2]
Hmm 

00:15:59,675 --> 00:15:59,984 [Speaker 0]
Uh- 

00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:01,236 [Speaker 1]
... come at you. 

00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:06,215 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Um, I will make a, a technical comment about the projector- 

00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:06,415 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:14,975 [Speaker 0]
... which is that, um, these projectors, uh, don't have a big projection while they're- 

00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:15,136 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:22,175 [Speaker 0]
... at the distance that is in the garage. They'd have to be a lot farther back, and then you have to make sure you have a good, clear, uh, path for them. 

00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:31,536 [Speaker 2]
For the eye lights, I was thinking you would just do it with LEDs. You have like, eight individual LEDs just mounted on a thing of cardboard that's- 

00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:31,715 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:32,776 [Speaker 2]
... hidden in the back. 

00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:35,136 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, but I mean, it's ... 

00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:36,836 [Speaker 2]
I, I, I don't know the technical 

00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:44,816 [Speaker 0]
What are you doing? I'll, uh- Yeah, it's just, it's just more of a, a physical thing than the fact that a projector is, like, you turn it on. 

00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:45,016 [Speaker 2]
Yep. 

00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:45,036 [Speaker 0]
Um- 

00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:48,795 [Speaker 1]
What if the projection is on the ceiling? 

00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:57,636 [Speaker 1]
What if the projection is like, we just have a white, uh, melamine or something on the ceiling, which could also block 

00:16:57,636 --> 00:17:06,076 [Speaker 1]
the garage door opener from being visible. And you project up from a location that people aren't, you know, i- in. 

00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,326 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. 

00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:17,136 [Speaker 1]
And you have it look like, you know, there's spiders that are dormant that are seeing you. There are spiders that start walking towards you. 

00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:22,735 [Speaker 2]
No. Uh, I would say not walking towards you, 'cause we still do want people to go through the room. 

00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:26,836 [Speaker 1]
What if they start walking towards you from this direction? 

00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:33,396 [Speaker 1]
What if you're walking, you start seeing eyes light up, and they start walking towards you from behind? 

00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,066 [Speaker 0]
Well, I don't really know what that means. 

00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,866 [Speaker 2]
I don't quite know what that means, 'cause also- 

00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,696 [Speaker 1]
'Cause it, it ... To get you to keep going forward. 

00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:49,836 [Speaker 2]
Becau- so my concern with the sense of walking towards you is there's eventual limit to how close they can get, and then what? They just stand there? Uh- 

00:17:49,836 --> 00:18:07,896 [Speaker 1]
Well, I, I don't know. Like, the, the ... I guess, like, the way I vaguely picture it is like, okay, you come in. You're, you're being cautious because you start seeing eyes, so they're waking up to your presence. They start walking towards you, so you feel an urge to go towards the exit. You start going towards the exit. You crunch. 

00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:08,136 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. 

00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:09,716 [Speaker 1]
Trigger the giant spider. 

00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:10,056 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. So, uh- 

00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:10,616 [Speaker 0]
Well- 

00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:16,166 [Speaker 2]
I do like ... So, again, I'm not ... It's the walking towards you part I'm not, still not sold on, but- 

00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:16,166 [Speaker 1]
All right 

00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:32,667 [Speaker 2]
... but part of what I did really like one of your ideas is that the, the sets of eyes-Yeah. Uh, a- as one moves- Yeah ... through the, through the hallway, the, the lights light up with you. As you go farther, there's a sequence of lights- 

00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:32,828 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,568 [Speaker 2]
... that lights up as you progress. 

00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:35,638 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:35,928 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:40,268 [Speaker 1]
So the whole place feels like, "Oh, there's way more spiders in here than I thought." 

00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:49,648 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. So, like, maybe you have two or three sets of eyes at the back end, so that when you first enter, there's a sense of- 

00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:49,968 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:54,778 [Speaker 2]
... "Okay, there's stuff in here." And then as you progress, "Oh, there's more and more and more and more and more." 

00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:54,778 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:55,988 [Speaker 2]
And then you get jumped by the big one. 

00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:56,067 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:01,858 [Speaker 0]
I can kind of think about how, how I could do the, them being physical LEDs actually. 

00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:18,688 [Speaker 1]
I ... But ... So, I don't quite like having a projector just for the sake of having a projector, 'cause to me, if we're trying to make it feel like, like impending doom, having the spiders walk in a random direction is not impending doom. 

00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:21,268 [Speaker 0]
Well, I just said that maybe we shouldn't use the projector. 

00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:21,758 [Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Okay. 

00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:24,768 [Speaker 0]
And I could see how we would do it with actual physical LEDs- 

00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:24,777 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, yeah 

00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:28,427 [Speaker 0]
... because then it's easier then to place each one- 

00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:28,508 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,748 [Speaker 0]
... and control when it happens. 

00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:35,128 [Speaker 1]
Why don't we, um, 

00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:46,348 [Speaker 1]
put, you know, like, Christmas lights or something, like red ... We can get cr- red Christmas lights and split up the circuits to put a time delay. 

00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:52,928 [Speaker 1]
So have something trigger so when you enter, it starts. And 

00:19:52,988 --> 00:20:04,308 [Speaker 1]
you put, like, resistors or something, like, to electronically delay each set of, you know, two or eight from triggering. 

00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:09,648 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, I mean, f- for me, it's easier to just use, like, neopixels- 

00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:09,678 [Speaker 1]
Oh, neopixels. Okay 

00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:14,148 [Speaker 0]
... and have the operator turn on, turn on, turn on. 

00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:14,188 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:14,568 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay. 

00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:16,698 [Speaker 2]
You al- you already have some manual control in this room. 

00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:16,708 [Speaker 1]
Okay, okay. 

00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,768 [Speaker 2]
And I feel like the engineering of it, y- one can figure out later that- 

00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:20,888 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,808 [Speaker 2]
... this is for the, the, the design of the room, is this meeting. 

00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:25,208 [Speaker 1]
All right, fine. 

00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,948 [Speaker 2]
So. 

00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:30,828 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Are we done about this room? 

00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:31,968 [Speaker 2]
I, I think so. 

00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:33,197 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:34,628 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Then are we done in general? 

00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:35,508 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:36,168 [Speaker 1]
All right. So if we're leaving the house- 

00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,088 [Speaker 0]
Well, I wanna close the garage. 

00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:38,768 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. 

00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:38,888 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:39,628 [Speaker 2]
All right. I really gotta use the bathroom. 

00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:40,788 [Speaker 1]
Go, go, go. All right.
