00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:14,140 [Speaker 0]
[footsteps] Okay. So we are now in what was called the trash room, surrounded by, uh, dead bodies on tables, hanging from the walls. And we had had, uh, UV paint in here for a number of clues. 

00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,920 [Speaker 1]
Okay. One thing about this room. 

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,180 [Speaker 1]
John did not know what he was doing. 

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,940 [Speaker 0]
So, uh- 

00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,210 [Speaker 2]
[laughs] 

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:30,540 [Speaker 0]
... in that, in that comment, uh, what is meant, because you can't see it, although I'll, I'll take pictures. Uh, I should go back and take pictures. 

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,439 [Speaker 1]
I'll take pictures. I'll take pictures. 

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:59,280 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Um, is that the skeletons in this room were supposed to represent, um, previous victims of the spiders that had been consumed to the point where they were just skeletons and a little bit of flesh. Uh, that wasn't, I guess, communicated clearly to John who was dressing up these props, and so what ended up happening is he ended up doing things like wrapping their heads in bags so that they suffocated. Uh, tying them- 

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,460 [Speaker 1]
I don't think he understood what the task was, and he just fucked around and decorated. 

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,160 [Speaker 0]
Tying them up, uh, as if they were hogtied. Uh, you know, doing- 

00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,840 [Speaker 1]
Giving them bloody, severed limbs. [laughs] 

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,420 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Which- which looked really interesting- 

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,430 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:31,440 [Speaker 0]
... but wasn't on theme. At one point, he'd made the comment like, "Oh, should we take some of the old wine bottles and, and strew them around as a comment against alcoholism?" And I was like, "But John, this is supposed to be about the spiders." Anyway, so then I came in here. Uh, I decorated the room. I hung up the, the skeletons. 

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,450 [Speaker 1]
Wow. 

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,080 [Speaker 0]
And then I painted numbers next to each skeleton, because the clue, uh, for this room- 

00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,090 [Speaker 1]
Thank you, John 

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,000 [Speaker 0]
... had been, uh, three and five. 

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,010 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:01:40,010 --> 00:02:08,740 [Speaker 0]
And so they were ru- nu- They were, um, tick mark style, not Roman numeral, of two, I purposely left out one. Two, three, four, five, and then in the corner, there was three and five, which was the eight. Initially, that was too hidden by people, so they actually, um, some of them missed it. So, we had to move the skeleton to make it a little more obvious that there was a skeleton there, because it was behind people, and that the, the, the- 

00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,109 [Speaker 1]
It wasn't even behind people 

00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,340 [Speaker 0]
... numbers were more obvious. 

00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:23,980 [Speaker 1]
It was the skeleton was essentially obfuscated by the wall when you enter the space, and there was enough visual information that people weren't focused on something in their periphery. 

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,540 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. No 

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:33,820 [Speaker 1]
And the skeleton that they needed to find, which was already in the periphery, was blocking the number that was supposed to indicate that it was the skeleton. 

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,100 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,420 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 'Cause I- 

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,239 [Speaker 1]
So- 

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,740 [Speaker 2]
Our, our group- 

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:35,870 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,860 [Speaker 2]
Because I will say, I, when I entered this room, I didn't notice this when first. 

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:38,900 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,660 [Speaker 2]
Our group was very obviously looking towards the table in the back wall. 

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:42,730 [Speaker 1]
Yep. 

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:42,740 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,780 [Speaker 2]
And then our, [laughs] party leader effectively with the flashlight- 

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,420 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:56,579 [Speaker 2]
... she looked at the body at the table, and then the last skeleton she got to was, was, was the one. 

00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:56,680 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,690 [Speaker 0]
Sure. 

00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,880 [Speaker 2]
Which on one hand, is kind of good- 

00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:58,950 [Speaker 0]
Yes. 

00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,060 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,240 [Speaker 2]
... that you, you interacted with all of it. 

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,880 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:01,960 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,160 [Speaker 2]
Uh, but just know that yeah, I agree, this, this was kind of obscure- 

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,210 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,359 [Speaker 2]
... which better or for worse, this was obscure. 

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,989 [Speaker 0]
Right. And it was intentional- 

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:10,019 [Speaker 1]
And before you got here- 

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,450 [Speaker 0]
... to be- 

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,460 [Speaker 1]
... it was blocking the number. 

00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,579 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:11,769 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:12,920 [Speaker 1]
So it was even more obscure. 

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,100 [Speaker 0]
Right. It was intentional that it would be like, a little obscure, but it was too obscure initially. 

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,210 [Speaker 1]
It was too obscure. 

00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,100 [Speaker 0]
And so, we need to buy us on it being a little bit more obvious. 

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,560 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,730 [Speaker 0]
Um. 

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,780 [Speaker 1]
Also, having, um, interesting deaths like this- 

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,580 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,160 [Speaker 1]
I feel like 

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:40,560 [Speaker 1]
if I was doing this without having an understanding of what they were supposed to look like, it would make me wonder like, "Oh, is there any indication about the way that they died being related to like, the numbers or something?" 

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:40,960 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,880 [Speaker 1]
So, I think that there was too much, uh, uh- 

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,480 [Speaker 2]
Visual noise? 

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,240 [Speaker 1]
Too much visual noise. 

00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,180 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,320 [Speaker 1]
Or too much narrative noise? 

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,480 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,690 [Speaker 1]
Like, 'cause, 'cause to me, what this looks like is like, an operating table. 

00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:56,720 [Speaker 2]
Mm. 

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,200 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,740 [Speaker 1]
And some, some like, which in some way it is, but the, it wasn't like there's, the spiders are surgeons doing- 

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:05,810 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,040 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,400 [Speaker 1]
... you know, crazy operations, and that would, that's not like what we were going for. 

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:21,339 [Speaker 0]
Right. And so to make a comment of the table for the record, the table was in this room for two purposes. One, to make this room a little bit less empty, so that people had to walk around something. 

00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:21,690 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,099 [Speaker 0]
And two, this table was originally supposed to be a pile- 

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,170 [Speaker 1]
Yes 

00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,830 [Speaker 0]
... of dead bodies. 

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,900 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,930 [Speaker 0]
Uh, so that A, it kind of was more interesting to look at and motivated why there was a table here. 

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:32,960 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:43,200 [Speaker 0]
But also B, there was originally supposed to be an animatronic under the table, that when they got c- when they were about to leave the other room, it swiped at them. So, it was supposed to also hide- 

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,620 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:52,900 [Speaker 0]
... another animatronic, which we did not do in this room. It was kind of nice though, that there wasn't an animatronic in this room, because it gave a little bit of relief, I think, to people. 

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,440 [Speaker 1]
From the animatronics. 

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,530 [Speaker 0]
From the animatronics. 

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,160 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:02,450 [Speaker 0]
I think it would also be interesting if there was a way to use what you were suggesting, but the body's like, pose is relevant. 

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:02,580 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,680 [Speaker 0]
But again, that would have to be a very obvious thing. 

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,860 [Speaker 1]
That is not what I was suggesting, but sure. 

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,620 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Well, I thought that was an interesting idea. 

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:07,680 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,700 [Speaker 0]
But it would have to be very obvious. It can't be subtle. 

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:10,760 [Speaker 2]
Yep. 

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,540 [Speaker 0]
It's way too easy to be subtle. Also, I wanna say- 

00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:13,750 [Speaker 1]
Well- 

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:13,750 [Speaker 0]
... on the- 

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,100 [Speaker 1]
... you could have their hands. 

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,480 [Speaker 2]
Well, my original idea, but I quickly concluded it would be too subtle- 

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,630 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:31,300 [Speaker 2]
... was that the, the ma- counts of three and five were like, painted on the bodies, that each body had, uh, yeah, way too complicated going- 

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,500 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,690 [Speaker 2]
... that each body had on like, four locations, hash marks between one and six. 

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:38,720 [Speaker 0]
Mm. 

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,219 [Speaker 2]
And only one of the bodies had a count of two, one count of three and one count of five. But- 

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,430 [Speaker 1]
What if- 

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,460 [Speaker 2]
... that's too much scrutiny. That's too, that, that's too subtle. 

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,539 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:05:49,540 --> 00:06:13,920 [Speaker 1]
What if I, I actually think that that could work though. What if instead of them being hung up like this, we just had piles of bodies that did have numbers on them, so you could have like, you know, 10 bodies, and then pretend that there's more. But the number that you're looking for is written on one of their bodies, so there's a physical act of moving bodies around. 

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,539 [Speaker 2]
So, yes, my, uh, yes, that is a fun way of getting people to be like, in the scene. That- 

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,440 [Speaker 1]
And interactive. 

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,060 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's more interactive. Just, it does mean there's more reset. 

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,280 [Speaker 1]
That's fine. 

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,900 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,159 [Speaker 2]
And you also then risk somebody breaking stuff. 

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,440 [Speaker 1]
We can fix things, though. 

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:39,460 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. A- and certainly, if you do end up putting the animatronic down here, and then you're having people interacting, they're robotic. So, yes. 

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,099 [Speaker 0]
Well, yeah. So, we would, there wouldn't be an animatronic in that situation. 

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,300 [Speaker 2]
So- 

00:06:42,300 --> 00:07:03,040 [Speaker 1]
I guess the reason I think that that would be good is because having them up is a lot of visual information. So, you don't necessarily know what to do, but if you just have a pile of bodies and use the flashlight and identify that, "Oh, the body has a number on it," then it's very clear that what your task is, is to move them around- 

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,150 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,150 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,440 [Speaker 1]
... and find the body. 

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:15,900 [Speaker 0]
Well, one place of synergy potentially there, was that when we were talking about there being a symbol on the previous body, is that that number could just be, again, an obvious like, attachment to the body- 

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,250 [Speaker 1]
Yes. Yes 

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,270 [Speaker 0]
... but it's now, which, you know, you have to find that right symbol. 

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,320 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,860 [Speaker 0]
Also, I wanna point out for the record, we hid the note inside the chest cavity. 

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,700 [Speaker 2]
Cool. Yeah. 

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,040 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,060 [Speaker 2]
Yep. 

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:36,000 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Uh, oh, and the last thing, uh, before we leave this room, again, going along with the theme of making things seem like rooms, we had to hang- 

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,920 [Speaker 1]
Yes. Yes 

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,940 [Speaker 0]
... a netting in-between the room to, to denote this is a barrier. Don't proceed, uh, through. 

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,280 [Speaker 1]
Yes. 

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,540 [Speaker 2]
Yep. 

00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,080 [Speaker 0]
Okay. All right. I'm gonna stop this. 

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,260 [Speaker 2]
Yep.
