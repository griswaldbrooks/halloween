# Victim Room - Retrospective

## Room Photos

*The victim room showing the twitching animatronic body at center with black plastic diffuser overhead blocking UV light, and static cocoons hanging from ceiling. The pink/red tent lighting creates an unsettling atmosphere.*

*The twitching victim animatronic wrapped in gauze/netting with visible servo mechanisms. This was highly effective but servo noise was an issue from adjacent rooms.*

*Static cocoons made from air-filled black trash bags wrapped in gauze, hanging from ceiling. Many guests didn't notice these above head height in the darkness.*

*Blood splatter painted on black plastic walls - unfortunately invisible in darkness despite coverage. UV paint quality and visibility was a major issue.*

## What Worked Well
- Twitching animatronic was creepy and effective
- Hearing before seeing built anticipation
- Black plastic diffuser worked well (blocked direct UV light view + hid animatronic initially)
- Cocoons made from air-filled black trash bags were lightweight and effective
- Skeleton body parts in cocoons added realism
- Message hidden on moving body was found by everyone
- Soundscape with multiple noise layers worked

## What Didn't Work
- **UV light bar too visible/bright** - Blinded people on entry before diffuser added
- **Servo noise betrayed animatronic** - Mechanical sounds ruined immersion from previous room
- **Blood splatter not visible** - Despite coverage, couldn't see it in darkness
- **UV paint quality poor** - Same fading issue as other rooms
- **Animatronic wrapping different** - Wasn't wrapped in same netting as other cocoons, looked separate
- **No giant cobweb on ceiling** - Would have justified hanging bodies
- **Static cocoons not noticed** - Hanging bodies above head height went unseen in darkness
- **Tent geometry challenging** - Difficult to mount animatronic in right position

## Improvements for Next Year

### Lighting & Visibility
- **Better UV light diffusion** - Black plastic worked, beef netting might work too
- **Keep light bar hidden** - Diffusion should block direct view of light source
- **Enhanced blood visibility** - Multiple strategies:
  - Higher quality UV paint that doesn't fade
  - Mix UV pigment into red paint
  - Add metallic paint for reflectivity/shimmer
  - UV-reactive blood concept (like Luminol for spider digestive juices)

### Sound Design
- **Motion-triggered audio** - Quiet moaning until entry, then LOUD wailing when activated
- **Mask servo noise** - Louder audio covers mechanical sounds
- **Dripping sound effects** - Audio cue to look for blood splatter
- **Layered soundscape** - Multiple complementary sounds (moaning, dripping, spiders skittering)

### Animatronic Improvements
- **Trigger mechanism** - Physically opening doorway causes body to drop/swing down, then starts thrashing
- **Better motor choice** - Different servo type that makes less noise (technical limitation noted)
- **Wrap in same netting** - Match appearance of other cocoons
- **Position lower initially** - Drop effect makes it more noticeable and dramatic
- **"Help me!" audio** - Makes it clear it's a victim, not dead body

### Environment & Staging
- **Giant spider web on ceiling** - Justifies hanging cocoons, looks intentional
- **Blood dripping effects:**
  - Fishing line "drips" (tactile element)
  - Dripping sound (audio cue)
  - Red wax/fake blood drips on cocoons (visual)
  - Projector animation (if budget allows)
- **Blood scent** - Can purchase blood scent for added immersion
- **Ceiling panel system** - Hide electrical components and wiring above

### Structure Improvements
- **Make reusable "Ikea haunted house"** - Sturdier but easy-to-breakdown structures
- **Weather-resistant** - Structure up for weeks needs to survive rain/wind
- **Proper mounting system** - Easier animatronic positioning accounting for tent geometry

## Key Insight
**Hearing is scarier than seeing** - Not being able to see the source of moaning/servo sounds builds anticipation. The reveal should be dramatic (drop/fall with loud wail).

## Sound Philosophy
"Noise is almost maybe already more valuable in horror than seeing stuff. Not seeing is scary."

## Technical Note
Hobby-type servos always make noise when moving due to their design. Changing this requires different motor types. Until then, mask with louder audio triggered on entry.
