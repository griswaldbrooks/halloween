# Hatchery - Retrospective

## Room Photos

*The hatchery entrance showing white egg sacs made from balloons and gauze hanging at the doorway. Green table visible in background demonstrates the "room too empty" issue - needed many more egg sacs to feel claustrophobic.*

*Interior view showing netting on ceiling (hiding wiring), more egg sacs, and the relatively sparse layout that needed to be filled with many more eggs.*

*The animatronic egg with spider legs partially extended. This shows the eye-level positioning that was dangerous and the legs that needed to extend much farther for dramatic effect.*

## What Worked Well
- Animatronic egg concept was good
- Trigger wire completely invisible in darkness - people wondered how it worked (triumph!)
- Four broken eggs for searching worked as intended
- Baby skeleton in egg holding message was creepy
- Netting on ceiling hid wiring effectively

## What Didn't Work
- **Ramp-up too slow** - Difference between idle and aggressive states too subtle
- **Not aggressive enough** - Final state should have been much more violent
- **Legs didn't extend far enough** - Needed to be more dramatic
- **Only two legs** - Should have multiple spider legs
- **Thud sound** - Legs hitting paper mache broke immersion (squeaking servo sound was fine)
- **Room too empty** - Not enough egg sacs, too much open space
- **Eye-level placement dangerous** - Could hit people in face
- **Tent rigging durability** - Tore from ceiling in high winds
- **Clear plastic walls visible** - Though not distracting in darkness
- **Wire/dressing too low** - Tall people hit heads on fundamental set pieces

## Improvements for Next Year

### Animatronic Egg
- **Much gentler idle state** - Slow, subtle movement
- **VERY aggressive triggered state** - Violent, startling motion when switch is hit
- **Extend legs much farther** - Several feet out from egg
- **Add more legs** - Multiple spider legs for realism (4-6 visible)
- **Pulley system for legs** - Mechanical extension/retraction
- **Use bendy spider legs** - Flexible so safe to touch, but don't aim at faces
- **Position lower** - Below eye level to avoid face hits
- **Eliminate thud** - Keep legs from hitting hard surfaces (paper mache)
- **Add skittering sounds** - Mask servo noise with appropriate audio

### Room Atmosphere
- **MORE egg sacs** - Big sacs that pervade the space
- **Various sizes** - 6" to 18" diameter balloons
- **Clustered placement** - Groups of eggs, not evenly distributed
- **Force navigation around them** - Make space claustrophobic, not open
- **Use entire space** - Move obstacles (wood pile) out of the way
- **Bigger balloons** - More materials were prepared but not used due to time

### Set Dressing & Wiring
- **Raise fundamental elements** - Wire, basic set pieces should be flush with ceiling (6'2"+ clearance)
- **Decorative drapery can be lower** - Things meant to push through are fine at any height
- **Large netting resource** - Use big decorative netting discovered late
- **Cobweb coverage** - Layer of cobwebs over clear plastic walls
- **Hide wire better** - Current placement hits tall people in forehead

### Structure & Durability
- **Improve rigging** - Something about rope rigging doesn't hold in high winds
- **More stable tent system** - Current setup tears from ceiling
- **Weather-resistant design** - Structure needs to last weeks through various weather

## Design Philosophy Insights
"You should try to put things in peoples' way. You should make them maneuver around things."
- Haunted houses should be opposite of functional interior design
- Force navigation, block sightlines, create discomfort

## Interesting Observation
The servo squeaking sound actually sounded appropriate (like skittering) to someone unfamiliar with animatronics. The **thud** when legs hit surfaces was the immersion-breaking sound, not the mechanical noise.

## Safety Note
Anything at eye level that moves aggressively is dangerous. Extend legs further but position egg lower, or use soft materials that won't injure if contact occurs.

## Future Idea
Have egg positioned so it's completely hidden until last moment - maybe behind other egg sacs or in alcove. Current position too visible from entry.
