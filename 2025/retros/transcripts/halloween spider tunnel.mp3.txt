00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,720 [Speaker 0]
Okay. We are now in the beginning of the spider tunnel. 

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:17,400 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. I, I, um, uh, me- I'm not, not sure if the following is valuable, but I kinda thought this first bend, there was an opportunity, there was a missed opportunity for ... 

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,080 [Speaker 2]
Something. Yeah. 

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,880 [Speaker 1]
A- again, we were so, so strapped for time. 

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:19,890 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:19,900 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,480 [Speaker 1]
But in general, in my experience, the group stepped out here and was like, "Neat. Cool," and then just kept going. 

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,890 [Speaker 0]
They rushed, like, right through it. Yeah. 

00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:26,890 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,610 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. They rushed right through it. Whereas more spider props or noises or ... I- I don't know. 

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,780 [Speaker 2]
Also, I was worried and I- it was explicitly as they entered here, telling them, "Watch your head." 

00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:37,860 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Uh-oh. 

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,360 [Speaker 2]
Because there is a- 

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,570 [Speaker 1]
Uh-oh 

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,760 [Speaker 2]
... obstacle there that we put foam on because I kept walking into it. 

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:44,860 [Speaker 1]
Oh. 

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,340 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,820 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,040 [Speaker 1]
Is this- 

00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,269 [Speaker 2]
It is foaming cardboard. 

00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,180 [Speaker 0]
I screwed foam to it. Yeah. 

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,600 [Speaker 2]
So- 

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:49,910 [Speaker 1]
And- 

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,400 [Speaker 2]
... nobody actually hit it and hurt themselves as far as I know. 

00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,520 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,120 [Speaker 2]
But I- 

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,440 [Speaker 1]
Is this though, like, part of the house or is this part of the tunnel construction? 

00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,080 [Speaker 0]
Tunnel construction. 

00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,980 [Speaker 1]
Okay. And you intentionally- 

00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,700 [Speaker 0]
Well, no. I mean- 

00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,060 [Speaker 2]
There's a- 

00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,780 [Speaker 1]
No, no, no. There's a stairwell here. 

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,360 [Speaker 2]
There's a s- yeah. So the stairwell is there- 

00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,209 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. So th- this is part of the house? 

00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,519 [Speaker 0]
[laughs] Uh, not this foam though. 

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,860 [Speaker 2]
It's a stairwell that we attached foam to. 

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,920 [Speaker 1]
Foam to it. Yes. Okay. 

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,160 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,539 [Speaker 2]
Yes. So we got lucky and nobody hit their head, but, you know, that's something that we could do in, in a more elegant m- fashion. 

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,380 [Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. Maybe with, um, with the UV, since the UV paint is a thing- 

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,540 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:19,820 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,950 [Speaker 1]
Maybe this edge is highlighted in the UV paint- 

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,980 [Speaker 2]
Yes. 

00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,060 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,560 [Speaker 1]
And you make it thematic that that way it's, it's obvious- 

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:26,650 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,200 [Speaker 1]
... you see it, but it, it can still be spooky and fit the theme. 

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,540 [Speaker 2]
What if the UV paint's dripping? 

00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,770 [Speaker 1]
Don't wanna drip it. No, I drip it. 

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:32,770 [Speaker 0]
No. 

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,390 [Speaker 2]
Don't drip it. [laughs] 

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:33,640 [Speaker 1]
[laughs] 

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:42,840 [Speaker 0]
Also, I think it would be, it would be better ... W- what we've learned about, like, making rooms explicit is that this should've hung way further down, so they had to- 

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,080 [Speaker 2]
Sure 

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,090 [Speaker 0]
... to pause a little bit. 

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,280 [Speaker 1]
Sure. Yeah. 

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,990 [Speaker 0]
Because people, they just ram into- 

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,630 [Speaker 2]
So that people- 

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,030 [Speaker 1]
I will say- 

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,560 [Speaker 2]
... feel that it's, it's a separate room. 

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:48,890 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:56,020 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. I will say, in that sense then with we've been talking about the different room count, if this is blocked off, people might think this is a room count. 

00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,740 [Speaker 2]
That's a- that's something else I was worried about. 

00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:57,750 [Speaker 0]
Yep. 

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,460 [Speaker 1]
Which maybe you do put the fir- maybe then you do put the first message in this room. 

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,040 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,350 [Speaker 1]
And then ... Because then it is more ... Yeah. You step out, spooky stuff, skeleton right there holding the first message. 

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,460 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,620 [Speaker 2]
Can I suggest something? 

00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,820 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,720 [Speaker 2]
That I think would be kinda cute. Um, what if ... You know we were talking about doing a diegetic map? 

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,160 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:42,620 [Speaker 2]
What if we do have a map, and we do have labeling of chambers, but instead of having only four chambers, we have multiple chambers, so that they are essentially red herring rooms, and each of these has spider hieroglyphics. So that the map could have spider hieroglyphics. 

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,810 [Speaker 1]
So the key rooms have the hi- like, if one is really paying attention- 

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,620 [Speaker 2]
No, no. All of them- 

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,350 [Speaker 1]
Yes. Okay 

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,320 [Speaker 2]
... have spider hieroglyphics as essentially room entrances. 

00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,820 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,280 [Speaker 2]
So when we enter that room, there's- 

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,329 [Speaker 1]
Oh 

00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,700 [Speaker 2]
... a spider language. 

00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,010 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,860 [Speaker 2]
And, like, a plaque for what the room is. 

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,690 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Where- 

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:08,269 [Speaker 2]
When you enter this room, there's spider hieroglyphic plaque for what the room is, and the map could have all of those. 

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:08,299 [Speaker 1]
Oh. 

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:16,840 [Speaker 2]
But because you have multiple chambers, you don't necessarily know which one contains clues. 

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,310 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,180 [Speaker 1]
Okay. 

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:28,700 [Speaker 2]
We don't tell them which one contains clues, but we could have something in the map that might lean towards looking at specific rooms. 

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:37,150 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Oh, okay. So, uh, to clarify, you intend the group to take the map with them? 

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,220 [Speaker 2]
No. 

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,180 [Speaker 0]
No. 

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,140 [Speaker 2]
Think. I intend for them to think. And what if the diegetic map- 

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,880 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,520 [Speaker 2]
... had, like, some kind of 

00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:55,760 [Speaker 2]
blood splatter in each of the rooms that actually have ... To have a puzzle that is UV light? 

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,240 [Speaker 1]
Hmm. 

00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,700 [Speaker 0]
So you should probably encourage them then in this room, in the antechamber ... Sorry, not in this room. In the antechamber, to really have to study the map- 

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:03,710 [Speaker 1]
Correct 

00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,980 [Speaker 0]
... if we were gonna go for that- 

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,090 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,450 [Speaker 0]
... that route. 

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:05,920 [Speaker 1]
Because that- 

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,470 [Speaker 0]
And maybe even have ... Remember how, like, we have the, the, the note-taking thing that they sometimes give in escape rooms? 

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,380 [Speaker 0]
So they could write their own little note. 

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,260 [Speaker 1]
'Cause that, that's my concern was ... Cool, you have a fun code about the chambers. 

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,269 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,260 [Speaker 1]
No one's gonna remember that if they just look at- 

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,680 [Speaker 2]
Well- 

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,310 [Speaker 1]
... if they just look at it in the- 

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,440 [Speaker 2]
... what's wrong with them going back? 

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,530 [Speaker 0]
Uh- 

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,520 [Speaker 2]
In, in an escape room, you can go back. 

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,820 [Speaker 0]
No. 

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,580 [Speaker 1]
No. 

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:28,670 [Speaker 2]
Why? 

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,580 [Speaker 0]
That's not good. 

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,000 [Speaker 2]
Why? 

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:49,340 [Speaker 1]
Be- so it, it, one, uh, like safety. Like, you then have to design obstacles to work in both directions, which is an extra consideration. Two, the coming and going, uh, eventually defeats the ambiance. Like, the more time you spend going through something- 

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,350 [Speaker 2]
Okay 

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,920 [Speaker 1]
... the less spooky it becomes. And so if people ... It also will dramatically, I think, increase the potential playtime. 

00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:25,780 [Speaker 2]
So why don't we then give ... So we ... Why don't we then either give people, like, a hint that they should take a picture of the map or we give them paper to draw the map with. And then when they're in here, they see some map on the b- wall. They don't know that there's any hints on the map indicating which rooms to look in. When they come in here and they flash around, they're like, "Oh, this is cool." They come over here. We put glowing hieroglyphics to essentially identify that there is a fucking barrier here- 

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,110 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:37,080 [Speaker 2]
... that they would literally hit their head on. And the ... When they shine the glowy light on it, they see runes. Then they might wonder, "Oh, interesting." 

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,920 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. I would say we- 

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,400 [Speaker 2]
I saw runes in there. 

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,580 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. So I, I- 

00:05:40,580 --> 00:06:01,280 [Speaker 2]
Oh, I'll look at the map. And then they understand why we either encourage them to take pictures of the map or [upbeat sound] they drew a map. And then they can go ... Essentially only make them go back from this point, draw a map, then proceed.

00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:10,208 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. Uh, I, I think for the, the, the time at hand for this present exercise, we should just make a note to workshop this map idea better. 

00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:10,898 [Speaker 2]
Okay. 

00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:10,908 [Speaker 1]
Um. 

00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:11,038 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,688 [Speaker 2]
'Cause I think it could be useful. 

00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:24,838 [Speaker 1]
And not, not- ... Um, can ... Uh, quickly, a thing that came to mind is, what if, uh, in addition to the diegetic map up front, that you don't take with you, that you don't ... You know, you look at it in the room. 

00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:24,888 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:43,078 [Speaker 1]
That in the local rooms, in addition to these hieroglyphics, you get, uh, an indication of the present room and the exits of ... in a certain sense. So you get a map of just the immediate space. Maybe those are tagged with- 

00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:43,328 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:43,778 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:53,218 [Speaker 1]
Again, I still have some concerns about how s- how spooky that ... nece- How spooky do you make it when somebody knows what's the layout of the haunted house? 

00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:53,218 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:53,268 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:06:53,268 --> 00:07:14,788 [Speaker 1]
So that aside, maybe, maybe the map to bridge the gap between letting people come back or people carrying a map with them, that in each room at the different entrance ways, in addition to the spooky hieroglyphs, you get a little mini version that just shows this room, or the immediate room and where the exits are. 

00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:15,248 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. 

00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:15,268 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:20,288 [Speaker 1]
I don't know. 'Cause yeah, gives you, helps you with a little bit of orientation without giving you the whole thing- 

00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:20,378 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:21,478 [Speaker 1]
... to hold around the whole time. 

00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:24,418 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. I will ... I need s- n- to bring up one technical detail. 

00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:24,478 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,748 [Speaker 0]
Is that the, the particular UV paint that we got actually fades relatively quickly. 

00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:30,148 [Speaker 1]
Mm. 

00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:34,968 [Speaker 0]
Right? So initially, it's really obvious that it's there. When people have, like, the flashlight- 

00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:35,268 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,508 [Speaker 0]
... just a little bit of light would draw your eye to it, right? 

00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:37,868 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:44,328 [Speaker 0]
But even after the course of like 10 minutes, it had to be something that you kinda ... And you had to know that you need to point the light at- 

00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:44,408 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:45,858 [Speaker 0]
Then it would show up. So it's not- 

00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:46,638 [Speaker 1]
I will say, our final- 

00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:48,078 [Speaker 2]
But, but there are- 

00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:51,268 [Speaker 1]
... run through of like the ... in the trash room. 

00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:51,468 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, you- 

00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:53,087 [Speaker 1]
Admittedly, it was kinda faint. 

00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:53,328 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:55,028 [Speaker 2]
But there are better UV paints. 

00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:55,548 [Speaker 1]
[laughs] 

00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:57,788 [Speaker 0]
And there's other UV materials we could use. 

00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:59,168 [Speaker 2]
Yes. So we should consider that. 

00:07:59,168 --> 00:07:59,288 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:10,508 [Speaker 2]
Can I suggest something before we leave? I'm sorry. Sorry to do this to you, Dan. Um, I think that overall, maybe we don't take this down yet 

00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:15,207 [Speaker 2]
and we, we recuperate a little bit, clean the house. 

00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:16,108 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:19,957 [Speaker 2]
And not next weekend, but maybe the following weekend- 

00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,608 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:25,067 [Speaker 2]
We try to implement some of these changes and just keep the structure up. 

00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:25,957 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:31,688 [Speaker 2]
And just have another party. Not, not have a bunch of food. Just have like chips and dip or something. 

00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:32,278 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,847 [Speaker 2]
And invite friends over to play test it. 

00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:45,907 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. I will say that I definitely wasn't going to take anything down until after Tuesday, because it's gonna rain on Monday. And so like, I wasn't gonna like, have something half-built- 

00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:45,978 [Speaker 2]
Right 

00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:46,638 [Speaker 0]
... while it's wet. 

00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:46,748 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:48,388 [Speaker 0]
And then it needs time to dry and, and so on. 

00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:48,617 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:48,628 [Speaker 1]
Yep. 

00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,208 [Speaker 0]
All right, let's proceed to the next- 

00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,847 [Speaker 2]
All right. Next area. 

00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:57,208 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. This is still the, the, the, the f- the first funnel area. 

00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,178 [Speaker 2]
[laughs] That's so obvious in the light time. 

00:08:59,178 --> 00:08:59,877 [Speaker 1]
[laughs] 

00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:04,348 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Um, but it was not ... Like, when we actually came in, in, in real life, it was not obvious. 

00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:04,367 [Speaker 1]
No. 

00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:11,108 [Speaker 0]
You couldn't see any wires. So we're standing in front of the, the skeleton that had the first clue and the window jump scare. 

00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:11,188 [Speaker 2]
Um- 

00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:16,958 [Speaker 0]
So one of the comments I heard, uh, for sure was that, um, the window jump scare needed sound. 

00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,008 [Speaker 2]
Yes. 

00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:19,808 [Speaker 1]
Oh, totally. Yeah, yeah. Jump scares operate on sound. 

00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:20,848 [Speaker 2]
It was not scary at all. No. 

00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:21,068 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, it wasn't scary. 

00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:21,168 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:24,388 [Speaker 0]
Uh, it wasn't as obvious. The projector worked well ... 

00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:24,628 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm 

00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:32,108 [Speaker 0]
... but the, the, the sheet had to be secured properly. Need to use a smaller computer. There was no reason to use such a large computer. 

00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:32,468 [Speaker 2]
[laughs] 

00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:32,888 [Speaker 1]
[laughs] 

00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:33,858 [Speaker 0]
Um, it was just- 

00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:35,248 [Speaker 2]
But we were working with what we had. 

00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:36,328 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, just in the moment. 

00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:36,578 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:45,228 [Speaker 0]
And we ended up having to put up this, this, uh, spiderweb barrier, because people weren't stopping in front of the animatronic. 

00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:45,288 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:53,698 [Speaker 0]
And then the animatronic or the skeleton itself needed to have its hand out more, because people didn't notice. 

00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:53,708 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:09:53,708 --> 00:10:01,288 [Speaker 0]
And so they needed to kind of like have it not quite block them, but be obvious. Like, "Oh, that's a thing, not just a decoration." 

00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:01,648 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:05,908 [Speaker 2]
Can we put sigils on the skeletons? 

00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:06,867 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:13,688 [Speaker 2]
I think we should put little bird sigils on the skeletons to indicate that they are the little birds. 

00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,728 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Well, if we keep with the various theme. 

00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:23,577 [Speaker 2]
Right, right. But like something that if, if like the way that the house ... Uh, the, the way that the s- the system works is that- 

00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:23,577 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:26,268 [Speaker 2]
... there are four individuals that are important. 

00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:26,508 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:31,988 [Speaker 2]
We could have a subtle, subtle thing to at least identify particular ones. 

00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,988 [Speaker 0]
Nothing should be subtle in the haunted house. 

00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:34,017 [Speaker 2]
Okay, fine. 

00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:36,578 [Speaker 0]
Because like it's A, dark. B- 

00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:36,578 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:43,587 [Speaker 0]
... people are in the moment. I like the idea of it ... of having like an identifier, so that should be like, you know, well- 

00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:44,788 [Speaker 2]
It doesn't have to be big, but just- 

00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:51,588 [Speaker 0]
No, it needs to be big. When, when I was talking to people and we were walking through, people missed all sorts of subtle things, right? 

00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:51,738 [Speaker 1]
Yeah. 

00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:51,768 [Speaker 2]
Right. 

00:10:51,768 --> 00:11:03,508 [Speaker 0]
So it needs to be like, like ... I'm sorry. I'm holding my hand up right now. It needs to be like objects are relatively hand-sized and well-lit or, or like obvious. 

00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:03,587 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:10,028 [Speaker 1]
I, I will say, though, uh, just to keep it on people's mind for the record. Uh, 

00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:20,308 [Speaker 1]
next time, the narrative should better refine, focus on are the clue bearers previous agents of the Spy Master? 

00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:20,627 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:25,887 [Speaker 1]
Or are they traps, messages left behind from the cultists? 

00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:26,218 [Speaker 2]
Yes. 

00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:38,367 [Speaker 1]
Like, because again, I w- I wrote it as cultists, but for clarity of k- of, uh, informing the p- the players for the game, we switched to they were being, um, 

00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,828 [Speaker 1]
agents of the Spy Master. So just that- 

00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:40,918 [Speaker 0]
Right. So- 

00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,708 [Speaker 1]
... that is something to be considered. That just has to be- 

00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:47,418 [Speaker 2]
I had imagined it as agents of the Spy Master to begin with. I wasn't fully- 

00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:47,418 [Speaker 1]
Correct. Yeah 

00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:51,828 [Speaker 2]
... involved with like ... I didn't fully digest the clues that you wrote. 

00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:52,448 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:11:52,448 --> 00:12:06,858 [Speaker 2]
What could work, and we don't have to have the same storyline next time, but for this storyline, what could have worked is they were my agents that ate the fucking candy or something. 

00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:06,887 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:10,568 [Speaker 2]
Like that, that, that, um, 

00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:13,108 [Speaker 2]
that basically 

00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:23,468 [Speaker 2]
... We're sent here to spy on the l- on the spi- on the spiders and they ended up joining in and dying from, from that integration. 

00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:32,377 [Speaker 1]
Mm. Yeah, I also think this is a ripe opportunity to make the Spy Master part of the cult. Like that was an idea we kicked around. 

00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:32,387 [Speaker 2]
Mm. 

00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:35,728 [Speaker 1]
And I couldn't really quite find an obvious way to communicate- 

00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:35,738 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,408 [Speaker 1]
... and so I just kinda dropped it. 

00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:37,768 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:41,208 [Speaker 1]
Uh, and then also, the, uh, the ar- 

00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:45,548 [Speaker 1]
... My first draft of the messages, before I understood the game mechanics- 

00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:45,728 [Speaker 2]
Yeah 

00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:56,887 [Speaker 1]
... it was written as they were agents of the Spy Master who died in there and the messages were like their journal notes for how the scene is the way that it was. 

00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:57,088 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. 

00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:59,788 [Speaker 1]
So just to get on record the things we went through. 

00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:00,198 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:07,637 [Speaker 1]
Like the, the, the types of ideas we, we tried before we, we did what we did. That's all just stuff that's you could be used next time. 

00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:07,707 [Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. 

00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,968 [Speaker 1]
But for, for the record. 

00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:12,988 [Speaker 0]
Right. Okay, so I think we're done with the spider tunnel. 

00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:13,478 [Speaker 2]
Sure. 

00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,828 [Speaker 0]
'Cause I don't think that there's any notes about that part, right? 

00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:16,267 [Speaker 1]
No. 

00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:19,088 [Speaker 0]
Okay, so I'm gonna stop this recording and save it. 

00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:28,108 [Speaker 2]
That, that gave me a funny idea for how to do this as Nightmare Before Christmas. Um, but I don't wanna interject that right now if you don't want.
