00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,900 [Speaker 0]
All right. 

00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,080 [Speaker 1]
Okay, recording. 

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:18,970 [Speaker 0]
Um, s- antechamber candy room comments. More decorations to better integrate it into the theme. Uh, the candy should be better framed as a part of the story rather than just ancillary candy. 

00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,020 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:27,140 [Speaker 0]
Maybe even have one piece of custom candy per each member of the group to make it more ritualistic and targeted. 

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,680 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:40,680 [Speaker 0]
Uh, maybe giving or generating some sort of map g- uh, of what's to come, but not too specific to still allow for, uh, uncertain, creepy arrangement of the hall itself. 

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:40,720 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,660 [Speaker 0]
But a map to better inform the guests as to how many chambers. 

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,100 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,960 [Speaker 0]
Things like that. Um- 

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,180 [Speaker 1]
Maybe making that m- map a little bit diegetic- 

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,190 [Speaker 0]
Yep 

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,620 [Speaker 1]
... was one of the comments. 

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:51,700 [Speaker 2]
Yes. 

00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,940 [Speaker 1]
And then we had some, uh, comment about actually how the script has to be delivered. 

00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,700 [Speaker 2]
Yes. 

00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:57,750 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. 

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:19,280 [Speaker 2]
The script has to be delivered in order to have, uh, when the people are eating candy, uh, have them... essentially try to make it easier for them to pay attention. So the whole point of doing, uh, the candy portion in a ritualistic fashion is basically have, for example, four little, uh, 

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:32,100 [Speaker 2]
four little, um, spiders so that people do not have a choice in what candy they have and they feel compelled to consume 

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,320 [Speaker 2]
a ritualistic food item- 

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,820 [Speaker 1]
Yep 

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,980 [Speaker 2]
... that puts them in the mindset that they are being immersed in the narrative. 

00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:48,860 [Speaker 1]
Right. But then one of the things about the script was that there has to be an explicit, like, you know... there's, like, this intro portion. 

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:48,870 [Speaker 2]
Yes. 

00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,060 [Speaker 1]
You're doing the candy- 

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,080 [Speaker 2]
Yes 

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:59,190 [Speaker 1]
... but I'm not giving you instructions while you're eating the candy. And once that is done, then we say, "Okay, come back to me, and I'm gonna give you the next set of instructions." 

00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,260 [Speaker 2]
Right. 

00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,620 [Speaker 1]
Because we had the experience where people would eat the candy- 

00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,080 [Speaker 2]
And not pay attention to the instructions 

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,370 [Speaker 1]
... and then not pay attention to the instructions. 

00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:15,140 [Speaker 2]
So benefit of making it into a ritual is that I can literally be guiding them through a ritual where they physically pick up a piece of candy, put it in their mouth, eat it- 

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,760 [Speaker 1]
Yep 

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,940 [Speaker 2]
... and then once I've seen they've done what I told them to do- 

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,040 [Speaker 1]
Yep 

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640 [Speaker 2]
... as their leader- 

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,220 [Speaker 1]
Yep 

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,900 [Speaker 2]
... I proceed to the next step. 

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,940 [Speaker 1]
[laughs] 

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,420 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,440 [Speaker 1]
Right. 

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,460 [Speaker 0]
You have much, much more obvious control- 

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,590 [Speaker 2]
Yes 

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,460 [Speaker 0]
... of the scene. 

00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:35,120 [Speaker 1]
Right. And we experienced that it was important to say things like four rooms, four messages, retrieve. 

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,620 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:35,799 [Speaker 2]
Yes. 

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,120 [Speaker 1]
Et cetera. 

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,350 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, confusion what little bird meant, so- 

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,350 [Speaker 2]
Yes. 

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,790 [Speaker 1]
Confusion about... yeah, about, about niche- 

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,790 [Speaker 2]
Yes 

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,180 [Speaker 1]
... uh, character things that weren't explicitly explained- 

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,190 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,100 [Speaker 1]
... in the narrative. Okay. 

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,299 [Speaker 0]
All right. Cool. Um-
