# Trash Room - Retrospective

## Room Photos

*The trash room showing a hanging skeleton with interesting death pose and red/pink lighting. Black plastic sheeting creates walls. This demonstrates the "too much visual noise" issue - elaborate death scenes made people wonder if poses were clues.*

*Example of John's off-theme decoration - hogtied skeleton on operating table doesn't fit spider-consumption narrative.*

*The tick-mark numbering system on skeletons (2, 3, 4, 5 visible with 1 missing and 3+5=8 as answer). The answer skeleton was too hidden initially.*

## What Worked Well
- Number puzzle concept was good (tick marks: 2, missing 1, 3, 4, 5, then 3+5=8)
- Hiding note in chest cavity was effective
- No animatronic provided relief from jump scares
- Netting barrier between rooms worked to define space

## What Didn't Work
- **Decorator didn't understand theme** - John decorated off-theme (bags over heads, hogtied victims, bloody severed limbs, alcohol commentary) instead of spider-consumed corpses
- **Answer skeleton too hidden** - Initially behind people in periphery, blocking its own number
- **Too much visual noise** - Interesting death poses made people wonder if deaths were clues
- **Too much narrative noise** - Operating table aesthetic confused the spider-consumption narrative
- **Table underutilized** - Was meant to hide animatronic and be pile of bodies, ended up just spacing element

## Improvements for Next Year

### Theme Consistency
- **Clear direction for helpers** - Explicitly communicate what each prop should represent
- **Spider-consumed aesthetic** - Skeletons with minimal flesh, webbing, not torture/murder scenes
- **On-theme only** - No random additions (like wine bottles for alcoholism commentary)

### Puzzle Design
- **Make clue more obvious** - Skeleton with answer shouldn't be in periphery or blocking its own number
- **Reduce visual noise** - Keep death poses simple and consistent
- **No red herrings** - Don't make people wonder if pose/style of death is part of puzzle

### Interactive Elements (Future Ideas)
- **Piles of bodies to search through** - More interactive, physically moving props around
- **Numbers on bodies** - Clear markings that require searching/touching
- **Body identifiers** - Obvious symbols/sigils attached to clue-bearing bodies
- **Better staging** - Front-and-center placement for critical puzzle elements

### Animatronic Considerations
- **Consider keeping it animatronic-free** - Providing relief was valuable
- **If adding animatronic** - Under table, behind pile of bodies, swipes at ankles on exit

## Key Design Principle
**Make key elements obvious and central** - Put puzzle solutions front and center, not in periphery. The last skeleton the group checks should not be the answer.

## Note for Future Setup
Table was originally meant to:
1. Make room less empty (force navigation around something)
2. Hide pile of bodies on top
3. Conceal under-table animatronic that swipes at ankles

Consider implementing full original vision if time allows.

## Quote to Remember
"I don't think he understood what the task was, and he just fucked around and decorated."
