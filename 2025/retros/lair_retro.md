# Spider's Lair (Garage) - Retrospective

## Room Photos

*The lair entrance showing the too-narrow, too-low entry under the garage door. Large decorative netting successfully transformed the garage but the entry forced single-file passage and created head injury risk.*

*Interior view of the lair demonstrating the "triumph" of the netting - successfully hid all garage elements in darkness. However, team wanted a more minimalist white liminal space aesthetic instead of this cluttered approach.*

*Sally, the paper mache spider jump scare, mounted on linear rail. Shows the limited extension - needed to come out 2-3x farther. Also shows visibility issue - spider partially visible before jump scare.*

*The netting barrier attached to middle garage door handle that blocked half the entry width and forced narrow single-file passage.*

## What Worked Well
- Jump scare worked on everybody
- Netting was a triumph - made garage disappear in darkness
- Manually operated spider was better than automatic (timing control, fun to operate, watch reactions)
- Misdirection concept (look left, spider jumps right)
- Overall creepy atmosphere achieved

## What Didn't Work
- **Entry too narrow** - Middle handle blocked half the doorway, forced single-file entry
- **Entry too low** - Had to duck under garage door (head injury risk)
- **Couldn't get group photos** - Single-file entry prevented capturing whole group's scared faces
- **Spider rail too short** - Couldn't extend far enough for dramatic effect
- **Spider visible before jump scare** - Sally partially visible, needed better hiding
- **Projector not effective** - Low contrast on netting, wrong position, blocked by other netting
- **Too much decoration** - Wanted minimalist liminal space, got cluttered garage
- **Ran out of white sheets** - Would have improved projection surface

## Improvements for Next Year

### Entry Design
- **Garage door fully open** - No ducking, safer
- **Use cobwebs as visual barrier** - Block view without physical hazard
- **Wider opening** - Remove middle netting, allow 3-4 people to enter together
- **Photo opportunity** - Wide entry allows group photo during jump scare
- **Mounted camera idea** - Install camera above for automatic scared-face photos

### Spider Mechanics
- **Longer throw distance** - Spider needs to come out 2-3x farther
- **Switch from rail to rope/swing system** - Manual operation is staying, but better mechanism needed
- **Rope pull reveal** - Pull rope to raise garage panel curtain and simultaneously launch spider
- **Hide spider completely** - No legs visible until jump scare
- **Higher starting position?** - Dropping down like real spider (but similar to victim room drop)

### Room Aesthetic (Major Redesign)
- **Minimalist "liminal space"** - White cobweb tunnel, nothing else
- **Funnel-web spider aesthetic** - Feeling of entering spider's actual web
- **Hide everything** - Cover all garage elements (shelves, tools, door, etc.)
- **White flat surfaces** - Better for projections
- **Distinctly different from other rooms** - Each room should have unique visual character
- **No bodies/props** - Already used in trash room; keep this space clean/stark
- **Uncomfortable entry** - Obvious creepy space you must walk through anyway

### Projection & Lighting
- **Better projection surface** - White sheets instead of bare netting
- **Curved wall of fabric** - With cobwebs on it for texture
- **Reposition projector** - Point at front walls from back of garage (opposite side)
- **Or skip projector entirely** - Use LED spider eyes instead

### LED Spider Eyes System (Preferred Idea)
- **Sets of 8 small LED lights** - Arranged like spider eyes
- **Progressive activation** - Eyes light up as guests move through space
- **Multiple sets** - 2-3 at back initially, more light up as you progress
- **Positioned back-left** - Draws attention away from spider on right
- **Manual or automated control** - Operator controls timing
- **Blinking pattern** - Occasionally blink in and out
- **Watching effect** - Feels like being observed

### Sound Design
- **Skittering sounds** - Continue from tunnel
- **Occasional larger skitters** - Implies bigger creature present
- **Louder sounds on trigger** - Spider screech when it jumps

### Floor Elements
- **Eggshell crunching** - Paper mache half-eggs on floor
- **Tactile feedback** - Breaking sounds as you step
- **Could trigger spider** - Stepping on eggs wakes mama spider
- **Position strategically** - Near middle where eyes have drawn attention left

## Rejected Ideas (With Reasoning)
- **Spider eyes on ceiling projector** - Too many technical constraints, LEDs easier
- **Eyes walking toward guests** - Unclear where they'd stop, might block exit psychologically
- **Bodies/decoration** - Each room needs distinct character, already used in trash room

## Photo Opportunity Strategy
"The final thing, the jump scare worked on everybody... I couldn't get a picture of any group of four being jump scared."
- Wide entry allows whole group side-by-side
- Mounted camera or operator position
- Memento of the experience (like roller coaster photos)

## Manual vs Automatic
Unanimously agreed manual operation was superior:
- Timing control based on group behavior
- Fun for operators
- Watching reactions was rewarding
- Can adjust intensity per group
- More reliable than sensors

## Key Design Goal
Create an alien, uncomfortable space that doesn't look like anything familiar - a true liminal space where you know something is wrong but have to enter anyway.

## Quote to Remember
"I wanted it to be like a white room made with cobweb, essentially, that you feel like a liminal space... You know there's probably a jump scare coming, but you're still walking into it and the whole place is eerie because none of it looks like anything familiar."
