# Spider Tunnel - Retrospective

## Room Photos

*The spider tunnel showing the purple UV lighting, webbing overhead, and the twisting corridor. Black plastic walls create the tunnel effect, with visible cobweb decorations.*

*The head hazard area with foam padding on the stairwell overhang - note how visible it is in daylight but was a safety concern in darkness.*

*The skeleton holding the first message - this needed to be more prominently positioned with hand extended further to block the path.*

*The window jump scare display - effective visually but completely ineffective without sound.*

*Spider web barrier that was added to force guests to stop and look at the skeleton - initially people rushed past without noticing.*

## What Worked Well
- Projector effect created good atmosphere
- UV paint concept for hiding elements
- Spider web decorations were effective
- Wiring/electronics hidden well in darkness

## What Didn't Work
- **First bend was rushed** - People stepped out and immediately rushed through, missed opportunity for scare/prop
- **Head hazard obstacle** - Stairwell overhang with foam padding worked but required verbal warning ("watch your head")
- **Window jump scare not scary** - Completely ineffective without sound
- **UV paint faded quickly** - After 10 minutes, had to know to point light at it to see it
- **Skeleton with clue not obvious** - People didn't notice hand holding message
- **Too subtle overall** - Dark environment + people in-the-moment means subtle things are completely missed

## Improvements for Next Year

### Physical Safety & Design
- **UV paint on head hazard edge** - Make obstacles thematic and visible using UV paint (e.g., dripping pattern)
- **Hang barriers lower** - Force people to pause and recognize room boundaries
- **Better foam padding placement** - Ensure safety without verbal warnings

### Scares & Effects
- **ADD SOUND TO WINDOW SCARE** - Jump scares operate on sound; without it, completely ineffective
- **Smaller computer for video** - No reason to use large computer for display
- **Secure projection sheet properly** - Keep taut for better image
- **Spider web barrier needed** - People won't stop unless forced to

### Clue Placement
- **First message in tunnel?** - If blocking entrance to make it feel like a room, place first message here (skeleton holding it)
- **Make skeletons obvious** - Hand needs to be extended, blocking path (not just decoration)
- **Add sigils/identifiers** - Mark clue-bearing skeletons with obvious symbols (not subtle!)
- **Better UV paint** - Invest in quality UV paint that doesn't fade

### Atmosphere
- **More spider props/noises** at first bend to prevent rush-through
- **Better netting discovered late** - Large decorative netting

 (found in garage) would have been perfect for coverage

### Map & Orientation Concepts (Brainstormed)
- **Diegetic map with spider hieroglyphics** - Mark chambers with symbols
- **Red herring rooms** - More chambers on map than have clues (adds puzzle element)
- **Local room maps** - Mini-maps at each entrance showing immediate area + exits
- **Note-taking materials** - Let guests draw their own maps
- **UV secrets on map** - Blood splatters or markings visible only with UV light

## Key Takeaways
- **NOTHING SHOULD BE SUBTLE** - Dark environment + scared people = they miss everything that isn't obvious and well-lit
- **Sound is essential for scares** - Visual-only effects fall flat
- **Test and iterate** - Keeping structure up longer would allow refinement (plan to do test runs before event)
- **Make objects hand-sized and well-lit** - Scale matters for visibility

## Quote to Remember
"Nothing should be subtle in the haunted house. Because like it's A, dark. B, people are in the moment."
