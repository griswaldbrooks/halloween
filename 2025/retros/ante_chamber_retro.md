## What Worked Well
- The candy concept as a lure was effective
- Room served its purpose as an inviting entry point
- The ritual candy concept has potential

## What Didn't Work
- Decorations didn't integrate well into the spider theme
- Candy felt ancillary rather than part of the story
- Script delivery timing was problematic - people ate candy and stopped listening to instructions
- Confusion about narrative elements (e.g., "little bird" references)
- Unclear who the clue bearers were (agents of Spy Master vs cultists)

## Improvements for Next Year

### Theme Integration
- **More thematic decorations** - Better integrate candy room into spider/cult narrative
- **Candy as story element** - Frame candy as ritualistic offering, not just free candy
- **One piece per person** - Custom candy for each group member makes it more ritualistic and targeted

### Script & Instructions
- **Explicit instruction pauses** - Give instructions, STOP, wait for candy eating to complete, then continue with next instructions
- **Guided ritual** - Leader should guide each step: "Pick up candy. Put it in your mouth. Eat it." Then proceed to next step
- **Clear, explicit information** - Say things like "four rooms, four messages, retrieve"
- **Avoid niche references** - Don't use obscure character names or lore that isn't explicitly explained

### Orientation
- **Diegetic map** - Provide a map that fits the story (spider hieroglyphics, chamber markings)
- **Room count clarity** - Make it obvious how many chambers they'll go through
- **Consider note-taking materials** - Like escape rooms provide (whiteboard, paper) so guests can track information

### Narrative Clarity
- **Define clue bearers** - Are they previous agents of the Spy Master, or cultist traps?
- **Spy Master role** - Consider making Spy Master part of the cult for narrative cohesion
- **Consistent story** - Ensure all narrative elements tie together and are communicated clearly

## Key Takeaway
**Control is key** - The host needs obvious, explicit control of the scene. People should follow clear steps in sequence, with pauses between instruction and action. Nothing should be subtle or require guests to infer meaning.
