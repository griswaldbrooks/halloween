# 2025 Halloween Haunted House - Overall Learnings & Improvements

## Executive Summary

The 2025 spider-themed haunted house was successful overall, with all major effects working and guests enjoying the experience. However, the retrospective revealed consistent patterns of issues across all rooms, primarily related to **subtlety**, **timing**, **visibility**, and **technical execution**. The key takeaway: **NOTHING SHOULD BE SUBTLE**.

## Individual Room Retrospectives

For detailed analysis of each room, see:
- [Ante Chamber (Candy Room)](./ante_chamber_retro.md) - Script timing, ritual candy, and narrative clarity
- [Spider Tunnel](./spider_tunnel_retro.md) - Sound for scares, UV paint issues, and clue visibility
- [Trash Room](./trash_room_retro.md) - Theme consistency and puzzle design
- [Victim Room](./victim_room_retro.md) - Twitching animatronic success and blood effect improvements
- [Hatchery](./hatchery_retro.md) - Claustrophobic egg maze and animatronic aggression
- [Spider's Lair (Garage)](./lair_retro.md) - Jump scare mechanics and liminal space design

## 🎯 Core Principles Discovered

### 1. NOTHING SHOULD BE SUBTLE
**The Golden Rule** - Repeated in every room discussion.

**Why:**
- Environment is dark
- People are scared/in-the-moment
- Limited time in each space
- Attention is divided

**Application:**
- Props should be hand-sized or larger
- Well-lit or glowing
- Positioned obviously
- Narrative elements must be explicit
- Physical blockers needed, not just visual suggestions

### 2. Sound > Visual for Scares
Hearing something scary is more effective than seeing it.

**Evidence:**
- Window jump scare completely ineffective without sound
- Victim room moaning built anticipation before seeing animatronic
- Servo noises broke immersion more than visual glitches

**Application:**
- Every jump scare needs audio
- Layered soundscapes (multiple complementary sounds)
- Use sound to mask technical limitations (servos)
- Dripping, skittering, moaning, screaming all effective

### 3. Each Room Needs Distinct Visual Character
Avoid repeating themes/aesthetics between rooms.

**Examples:**
- Bodies in trash room → Don't repeat in lair
- Drop-from-ceiling in victim room → Different mechanics in lair
- Each space should feel unique

### 4. Nothing Is Obvious Until It Blocks Your Path
People rushed through or missed elements unless physically forced to engage.

**Solutions:**
- Physical barriers (netting, lowered obstacles)
- Props that block path
- Obvious hand positioning (skeleton reaching out)
- Center placement, not periphery

## 🔧 Technical Learnings

### Materials & Supplies

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Large decorative netting (garage) - hide everything, create atmosphere
- ✅ Black plastic trash bags filled with air (lightweight cocoons)
- ✅ Beef netting for diffusion
- ✅ Paper mache eggs (concept - needed more)

**What Didn't Work:**
- ❌ UV paint that fades quickly (10 minutes)
- ❌ Hobby servos (always make noise)
- ❌ Clear plastic sheeting (visible in light but okay in dark)

**Needed Improvements:**
- Higher quality UV paint that doesn't fade
- Different motor types for quiet operation
- More white sheets for projections
- Weather-resistant structures

### Electronics & Automation

**Wins:**
- Hidden wires completely invisible in darkness
- Trigger mechanisms worked well (wire switch)
- Manual operation preferred over automatic (timing, control, fun)

**Issues:**
- Servo noise betrays animatronics
- Projector contrast poor on netting
- UV lights too visible without diffusion
- Tent rigging tears in high winds

**Improvements:**
- Mask servo noise with louder audio
- White sheet surfaces for projections
- LED spider eyes instead of projections
- Ceiling panels to hide wiring
- Reusable "Ikea haunted house" structures

## 🎭 Narrative & Guest Experience

### Script & Instructions
**Problem:** People eat candy and stop listening to instructions.

**Solution:**
1. Give instructions
2. PAUSE explicitly
3. Wait for action to complete (eating candy)
4. Resume with next instructions
5. Use guided ritual format

**Clarity Needs:**
- "Four rooms, four messages, retrieve"
- Avoid niche references ("little bird")
- Define story elements explicitly
- Provide maps/note-taking materials

### Game Mechanics
**What Worked:**
- Scavenger hunt with hidden messages
- Puzzles solvable with flashlight
- Physical interaction (reaching into egg)

**What Didn't Work:**
- Confusion about how many rooms/chambers
- Unclear who clue bearers were (story-wise)
- Too subtle puzzle elements

**Improvements:**
- Diegetic map with chamber markings
- Note-taking materials (like escape rooms)
- Clear count of objectives
- Consistent narrative throughout

## 🔨 Construction & Setup

### Time Management
**Major Issue:** Ran out of time for refinements.

**Evidence:**
- Fewer egg sacs than planned
- John decorated off-theme (unclear instructions)
- Projector positioning not optimal
- Many "would have been better if we had time"

**Solutions for Next Year:**
1. **Start earlier** - 2-3 weeks more prep time
2. **Test run before event** - Keep structure up longer for iteration
3. **Clear task assignments** - Explicit communication on what each prop should be
4. **Modular components** - Pre-build elements that can be quickly assembled

### Structure & Durability
**Problems:**
- Tents tore in wind
- Difficult to mount animatronics in right positions
- Had to repair weather damage multiple times
- Geometry constraints from tent shapes

**Solution:**
**"Make Ikea haunted house"** - Reusable, modular, weather-resistant structures
- Easy to assemble/disassemble
- Sturdy enough for weeks of weather
- Designed for animatronic mounting points
- Ceiling panels for wiring
- Proper geometry for tall people

## 🎓 Lessons from Each Room

### [Ante Chamber](./ante_chamber_retro.md)
**Lesson:** Control the scene explicitly. Guide guests step-by-step through ritual.

### [Spider Tunnel](./spider_tunnel_retro.md)
**Lesson:** Nothing is obvious. Add sound to scares. UV paint quality matters.

### [Trash Room](./trash_room_retro.md)
**Lesson:** Communicate clearly with helpers. Make answers central, not peripheral.

### [Victim Room](./victim_room_retro.md)
**Lesson:** Hearing is scarier than seeing. Mask technical noise. Make drops dramatic.

### [Hatchery](./hatchery_retro.md)
**Lesson:** Claustrophobic is good. Fill the space. Hide fundamentals higher.

### [Lair](./lair_retro.md)
**Lesson:** Liminal spaces are creepy. Each room should be visually distinct. Manual operation is superior.

## 📝 Final Thoughts

> "Nothing should be subtle in the haunted house. Because it's A, dark. B, people are in the moment."

The 2025 event was a success, but these retrospectives reveal clear paths for improvement. The single most important change is embracing that **obvious is good** - in darkness and fear, subtlety is lost. Next year should focus on:

1. **Bigger, bolder, louder** scares and effects
2. **Earlier start** with time for iteration
3. **Clearer narrative** and instructions
4. **Weather-resistant** reusable structures
5. **Sound-first** approach to scares
6. **Distinct visual character** per room

With these changes, next year's haunted house will be dramatically more effective while requiring less day-of stress and repairs.

**Ready for 2026!** 🕷️👻🎃
